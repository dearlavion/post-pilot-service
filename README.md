Post Pilot helps you automatically share your posts to multiple social media platforms â€” saving time and effort.

It supports three main posting methods:

> A. Quick Post
- Post single item at this instant

How it works:

1. Create a single post

2. Select which social media platforms to post to

3. Click "Post Now"

4. The system sends the posts and notifies the admin if each post was successful or failed


> B. Batch Post
- Post multiple items all at once every 12 AM.

How it works:

1. Upload a file with a list of posts

2. Select which social media platforms to post to

3. Click "Post at 12AM"

4. The system sends the posts and notifies the admin if each post was successful or failed

> C. Scheduled Post
- Post a single item at a specific time in the future.

How it works:

1. Create a post and set a date and time to publish

2. Choose the social media platforms

3. The system will automatically post it at the scheduled time

4. Admin gets notified if the post was successful or failed
